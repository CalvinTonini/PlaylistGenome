### Set-Up and Execution Instructions:
1. To enable crawling over public playlists, enter 'pip install spotipy' into 
   the terminal. The spotipy module allows you to interface with the Spotify API 
   over the network.
   
2. To use the crawler, you will need to acquire authentication credentials 
   through the Spotify API. We have provided various sample data sets already
   generated by the crawler for you to use. If you would like to generate your 
   own playlists.pyfile, enter your environment authentication variables into 
   the terminal one at a time before running the crawler. 
   
   To run the crawler, enter 'python crawler.py [username] [number]' into the 
   terminal. Replace [username] with the username you want to start crawling 
   from, and [number] with the number of playlists you want to crawl over.

3. To create a graph data structure from the raw data generated by crawler, 
   enter 'python graphmaker.py [playlists.pyfile]' into the terminal. Replace
   [playlists.pyfile] with the name of playlist pyfile you want to use 
   (e.g. playlists\_ramchris.pyfile).

4. To run the Floyd-Warshall's algorithm on your newly generated graph data
   structure, enter 'python fasterpathfinder.py [graph.pyfile]' into the 
   terminal. Replace [graph.pyfile] with the name of the graph pyfile you want
   to use (e.g. graph\_ramchris.pyfile). Running fasterpathfinder will generate
   a shortest distance matrix, a shortest path matrix, and a list of all the 
   songs in your graph. This information will be stored as dist.pyfile, 
   path.pyfile, and songlist.pyfile (respectively).
   
   NOTE: steps 1-4 MUST be completed before executing any of the following code!

5. To run Centrality Algorithms to find the most central song of your graph 
   data structure, enter 'python centrality.py [dist.pyfile] [path.pyfile] 
   [songlist.pyfile] [int between 0 and 3]' into the terminal. Replace 
   [dist.pyfile], [path.pyfile], and [songlist.pyfile] with the names of the 
   pyfiles you want to use (e.g. dist\_ramchris.pyfile, path\_ramchris.pyfile, 
   songlist\_ramchris.pyfile). Replace [int between 0 and 3] with a single 
   number (either 0, 1, 2, or 3). Each of these numbers refers to a different
   implementation of centrality within centrality.py, as follows:
   
   0: Bavelas's Closeness Centrality
   1: Harmonic Centrality
   2: Dangalchev's Centrality
   3: Betweenness Centrality

6. python generatepath.py path.pyfile songlist.pyfile 'song\_1' 'song\_2' 

7. python neighborfinder.py songlist.pyfile dist.pyfile 'song' [number]

8. python playlistneighborfinder.py path.pyfile songlist.pyfile

9. python triangles.py graph.pyfile 'song'
