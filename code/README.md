### Set-Up and Execution Instructions:
1. To enable crawling over public playlists, enter _pip install spotipy_ into 
   the terminal. The spotipy module allows you to interface with the Spotify API 
   over the network.
   
2. To use the crawler, you will need to acquire authentication credentials 
   through the Spotify API. We have provided various sample data sets already
   generated by the crawler for you to use. If you would like to generate your 
   own playlists.pyfile, enter your environment authentication variables into 
   the terminal one at a time before running the crawler. 
   
   To run the crawler, enter _python crawler.py [username] [number]_ into the 
   terminal. Replace _[username]_ with the username you want to start crawling 
   from, and _[number]_ with the number of playlists you want to crawl over.

3. To create a graph data structure from the raw data generated by crawler, 
   enter _python graphmaker.py [playlists.pyfile]_ into the terminal. Replace
   _[playlists.pyfile]_ with the name of playlist pyfile you want to use 
   (e.g. playlists\_ramchris.pyfile).

4. To run the Floyd-Warshall's algorithm on your newly generated graph data
   structure, enter _python fasterpathfinder.py [graph.pyfile]_ into the 
   terminal. Replace _[graph.pyfile]_ with the name of the graph pyfile you want
   to use (e.g. graph\_ramchris.pyfile). Running fasterpathfinder will generate
   a shortest distance matrix, a shortest path matrix, and a list of all the 
   songs in your graph. This information will be stored as dist.pyfile, 
   path.pyfile, and songlist.pyfile (respectively).
   
   **NOTE**: steps 1-4 _MUST_ be completed before executing any of the following 
   code!

5. To run Centrality Algorithms to find the most central song of your graph 
   data structure, enter _python centrality.py [dist.pyfile] [path.pyfile] 
   [songlist.pyfile] [int between 0 and 3]_ into the terminal. Replace 
   _[dist.pyfile]_, _[path.pyfile]_, and _[songlist.pyfile]_ with the names of 
   the pyfiles you want to use (e.g. dist\_ramchris.pyfile, 
   path\_ramchris.pyfile, songlist\_ramchris.pyfile). Replace 
   _[int between 0 and 3]_ with a single number (either 0, 1, 2, or 3). Each of 
   these numbers refers to a different implementation of centrality within 
   centrality.py, as follows:
   
   0: Bavelas's Closeness Centrality
   1: Harmonic Centrality
   2: Dangalchev's Centrality
   3: Betweenness Centrality
